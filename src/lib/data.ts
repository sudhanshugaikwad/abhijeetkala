    title: "A Love Letter to My Desk",

    content: `
      <p>I spend a lot of time at my desk. A lot. It’s where I work, obviously, but it’s also where I read, where I eat, and where I spend an embarrassing amount of time scrolling through Twitter. So, I’ve put a lot of thought into making it a place I actually want to be.</p>
      <p>My setup is pretty simple. I have a big monitor, a mechanical keyboard that I love, and a good mouse. I’m a big believer in the idea that you should invest in the things you use every day. A good chair, a good mattress, and a good desk setup are all things that will pay for themselves in the long run.</p>
      <p>But it’s not just about the gear. I also try to keep my desk clean and organized. I have a little tray for my keys and wallet, a pen holder, and a notebook for jotting down ideas. It’s not much, but it makes a big difference. A clean desk is a clean mind, as they say.</p>

    title: "The Joy of a Good Notebook",
    date: "January 15, 2024",
    content: `
      <p>I’ve tried all the apps. I’ve tried Notion, I’ve tried Evernote, I’ve tried Bear. They’re all great, but there’s something about a physical notebook that I just can’t quit. There’s a certain magic to putting pen to paper that you just don’t get with a screen.</p>
      <p>I use a notebook for everything. I have a daily to-do list, a section for long-term goals, and a place for random thoughts and ideas. It’s my external brain. I don’t know what I’d do without it.</p>
      <p>My notebook of choice is the <a href="https://fieldnotesbrand.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="underline">Field Notes</a>. They’re small, they’re durable, and they have a certain aesthetic that I really appreciate. I always have one in my back pocket.</p>

    title: "On Finding Your Uniform",
    date: "December 5, 2023",
    content: `
      <p>I used to spend a lot of time thinking about what to wear. I’d stand in front of my closet for what felt like hours, trying to put together the perfect outfit. It was exhausting.</p>
      <p>Then, a few years ago, I decided to simplify. I found a “uniform” that I felt good in, and I stuck with it. For me, it’s a black t-shirt, black jeans, and a pair of black boots. It’s simple, it’s comfortable, and it’s one less thing I have to think about in the morning.</p>
      <p>I’m not saying everyone should wear the same thing every day. But I do think there’s something to be said for finding a personal style that you’re comfortable with and sticking to it. It’s one less decision you have to make, which frees up mental energy for more important things.</p>
